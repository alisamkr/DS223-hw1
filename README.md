# DS223-Homework 1
## Overview

This project analyzes the diffusion of Apple Vision Pro, a mixed-reality headset that combines augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), in comparison to PlayStation VR (PSVR), a virtual reality headset designed for gaming. The analysis uses the Bass Model to estimate adoption rates and predict future user adoption over time.

## Task components
-Selecting an invention from Time Magazines "The 200 Best Inventions of 2023".
In this case, Apple Vision Pro

-Finding a similar innovation from the past. In this case, the PlayStation VR headset.

- Finding data about their sales
  PSVR Sales Data: https://www.statista.com/statistics/987693/psvr-unit-sales/

  Vision Pro Shipments (to identify market potential for estimations): https://www.statista.com/statistics/1398458/apple-vision-pro-shipments/

## Code implementation

-Bass Model Function: Predicts adoption based on parameters for innovation and imitation.
-Parameter Estimation: Finds optimal values for p,q, M using PSVR sales data.
-Adoption Prediction: Estimates future adoption rates for Apple Vision Pro.
-Visualization: Displays the predicted adoption curve.
-New Adopters Calculation: Shows the number of new adopters each year.

##Conclusion
Both Apple Vision Pro and PlayStation VR are well-known brands that can attract users globally, with no competing products offering the same quality. This analysis seeks to understand the potential adoption of Apple Vision Pro compared to PSVR.
